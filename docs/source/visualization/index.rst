Users are coloured, according to their last connection date to the course, to facilitate the detection of **risk of abandonment**, using the following coding:

* Red: if you have not connected for more than 13 days
* *Yellow*: if you've been online for 7 to 12 days.
* Blue: if you've been online for 3 to 6 days
* Green: if you've logged on in the last 2 days.

It also gives the option of applying four filters together, with multiple selection:

* **Text field**: filter the list by name and/or surname.
* Role Selector: Select the role you want to filter by (e.g. student, teacher, non-editor teacher, etc.)
* Group selector: select the group you want to filter by.
* **Last Connection Selector**: last access selector.

In the upper left corner, the number of participants that comply with the applied filters is displayed.


Student's file
--------------

If we select a student with the right button, a contextual menu appears *View <user name>* that launches a dialog to show the student's card.

  Student's file
  
This file shows: name, surname, email, last access dates to the subject and to Moodle, first access date to Moodle, roles, groups and number of courses/subjects you are enrolled in. 


Coloured circles are used to indicate the date of last login to the subject, or to Moodle, using the same criteria as seen previously in the list of registered users (i.e. red, yellow, blue or green).


In the right area, the complete list of courses in which you are enrolled is displayed. The list is shown by identifier, but can be sorted alphabetically in ascending or descending order by clicking on **Enrolled courses**.


The buttons at the bottom with arrows to the left and right allow you to go forward or backward in the list of students, updating the data.
